# 🌟 Welcome to the Enterprise Management System

This project is a sleek and efficient **Enterprise Management System** built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Designed with **Material-UI** for the frontend and powered by **Node.js** in the backend, it’s the perfect tool to simplify and organize enterprise operations.

## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page reloads automatically as you make changes.  
You may also see helpful linting errors in the console.  

### `npm test`

Launches the interactive test runner.  
Read more about testing [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).  

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.  
React is bundled in production mode and optimized for the best performance.  

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is now ready for deployment! 🎉  

For more details, check out the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).  

### `npm run eject`

⚠️ **Warning**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  

Use this command only if you need to customize the build tools (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.). After ejecting, all configuration files will be copied into your project, giving you full control.
